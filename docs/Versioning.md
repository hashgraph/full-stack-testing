# Versioning

## Overview
We support [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for FST releases.
Release will be tagged with a version number in the format of  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

## Versioning Policy
Major versions of FST are not tied to the major version of Hedara releases.
Each major release version of FST will be compatible with a range of Hedera releases, as described in the release notes.
